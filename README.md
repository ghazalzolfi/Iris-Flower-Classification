# Iris Flower Classification Using NumPy

This repository demonstrates the practical implementation of a vectorized classification algorithm for the classic Iris flower dataset. It provides an introduction to numerical computing concepts using NumPy, emphasizing vectorized operations and array manipulations essential for efficient computation and foundational machine learning.

### Project Overview:

### **1. Iris Flower Dataset:**
- **Dataset Description**:
  - Consists of measurements from 150 Iris flowers belonging to three distinct species:
    - Iris Setosa
    - Iris Versicolor
    - Iris Virginica
  - Each flower is described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
  - Dataset files:
    - `irises.npy`: Contains feature measurements of 120 flowers.
    - `types.npy`: Contains numeric labels (`0`, `1`, `2`) corresponding to flower species.

### **2. Classification Algorithm:**
- **Objective**: Classify Iris flowers into their respective types using simple yet powerful numeric computation techniques.
- **Methodology**:
  - Employed vectorized operations to efficiently compute distances and classification criteria.
  - Utilized NumPy's powerful indexing, broadcasting, and aggregation functions for streamlined computation.

### **3. Numerical Computation Techniques:**
- Practiced essential NumPy skills, such as array slicing, broadcasting, and aggregations.
- Demonstrated efficient computational strategies critical for scalable machine learning implementations.

### Key Learning Outcomes:
- Strong foundation in vectorized numerical computations with NumPy.
- Understanding of basic classification tasks and methods.
- Hands-on experience with a classic dataset widely used for educational purposes in machine learning.

### Libraries and Tools Used:
- Python
- NumPy (Numerical operations and vectorized computations)

This project provides a robust introduction to vectorized operations, dataset handling, and practical classification methodologies, forming a solid base for further exploration of machine learning concepts.
